      "RULES AND REGULATIONS",
      "PHARAOH: The Pharaoh is the most important piece for each side. If hit with a laser, it is destroyed and its owner loses the game. Similar to a king in chess, the Pharaoh pieces are comparatively weak, and so are often only moved if under duress.",
      "SCARABS: Scarabs consist primarily of large, dual-sided mirrors. They reflect a laser coming in from any direction, and thus cannot be eliminated from the board. Also, unlike other pieces, Scarabs may move into an adjacent square even if it is already occupied, by switching places with the piece found there (whichever colour it may be). Thus, they are the most powerful pieces on the board but must be used with care, as a move that puts one side of the mirror in a favourable position may expose the player to attack using the opposite side of the same mirror.",
      "SPHINXES: In KHET 2.0, the Sphinxes hold the lasers. They may not move (each player's is located at their closest right-hand corner) but may be rotated in place so as to fire down the rank instead of the file. A Sphinx is unaffected by laser fire, whether the opponent's or its own reflected back upon itself.",
      "ANUBES: Anubis has the advantage that, despite still being unmirrored, they are not affected by a laser strike on the front; they must be hit on the sides or rear in order to be eliminated.",
      "PYRAMIDS: Pyramids have a single diagonal mirror and form the primary mechanism for directing the path of the laser. They are vulnerable to a hit from two of the four sides and must be defended lest the player lose their ability to build paths of any size.",
      "",
      "PRELIMS-I",
      "In each turn, player will get max 2 minutes for the next 30 seconds (-1) will be added, and for the next 30 seconds another (-1) will be added.",
      "If he/she does not make any move in the stipulated time, then and there he/she will be eliminated and the opponent shall be declared as the winner.",
      "For each warning (-3) will be added for breaking any rule (i.e. 3 warnings) participants will be then and there eliminated.",
      "Marks division: Pyramid (5), Anubis (10), Rule breaking (-3).",
      "If participant hits his/her own element, then the corresponding marks will be deducted.",
      "If the total game time exceeds 15 minutes, then another 5 minutes will be given to end the game. In this case, no marks will be deducted from any participant but they will be warned.",
      "If the match is tied, then marks will be considered, and if marks will also happen to be the same then the total time taken will be considered.",
      "",
